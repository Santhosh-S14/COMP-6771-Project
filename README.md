# Clearing the Noise: An Investigation into Image Denoising with Autoencoders

This repository contains the code and data used in a study to evaluate the effectiveness of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in denoising images.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this study is the MNIST dataset, which consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits. The images are grayscale and have a resolution of 28x28 pixels. The dataset was split into a training set of 60,000 images and a test set of 10,000 images.

## Code

The code for this study was written in Python using the Keras library. The CNN model was trained on the training set and evaluated on the test set.

## Results

The results showed that the CNN model can preserve important features while effectively removing noise from the images.

## Conclusion

The study concluded that CNNs can be highly effective in denoising images and can be a promising approach for various image processing tasks. Further research could explore the use of CNN models in other image processing tasks and explore the optimal parameters and architectures for achieving even better results.
